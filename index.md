One of my favorite quotes comes American football legend Joe Namath,
> If you aren't going all the way, why go at all?

Here's a picture of my marvellous university.

I learnt how to write code in this university, 

```
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
```

 and it's safe to say I've come a long way since then.
